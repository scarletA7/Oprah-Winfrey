        Unless you have been living under a rock, you have heard of Oprah Winfrey. She is everywhere and even though her very successful talk show has been off of the air, her OWN television network is still up and running and her face continues to appear on her monthly magazine cover. Oprah Winfrey's career has spanned every form of media and beyond. She has had a turn in being an actress, talk show host, producer, and philanthropist. Among Oprah Winfrey's greatest accomplishments are being Chairwoman and CEO of both Harpo Productions and The Oprah Winfrey Network. She has co-authored five books, and has started The Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls, a school designed to educate and develop the leadership skills of young women in South Africa. And as if that's not enough, Winfrey has been featured in TIME Magazine's 100 most influential people on an impressive 10 occasions.

        Oprah is known as a philanthropist, who has overcome a traumatic childhood and gained recognition for her work. She's taken the world by storm, proving that a black woman can make it anywhere if she sets her mind and heart to it. At one point over the years, she was the richest single black woman in the world, who has proved time and again that anything is possible, if you know how to get it done.

         Oprah Winfrey was born in the rural town of Kosciusko, Mississippi, on January 29, 1954. In 1976, Winfrey moved to Baltimore, where she hosted a hit television chat show, People Are Talking. Afterward, she was recruited by a Chicago TV station to host her own morning show. She later became the host of her own, wildly popular program, The Oprah Winfrey Show, which aired for 25 seasons, from 1986 to 2011. That same year, Winfrey launched her own TV network, the Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN).
